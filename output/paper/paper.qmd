abstract: "This study analyzes death toll data across four civic centers (ET, NY, SC, and TO) from 2011 to 2023, with the goal of identifying seasonal patterns and regional differences in mortality. Utilizing death registry data, we categorized the deaths by season—Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall—and aggregated the death tolls across the years for each region. The analysis revealed notable variations in mortality trends across both seasons and civic centers. The results show that Winter consistently reported higher death tolls compared to other seasons across most regions, with the NY and ET civic centers experiencing the highest tolls during this period. In contrast, SC and TO exhibited more balanced seasonal distributions, with Summer showing a slightly elevated death toll. Using visual representations generated through ggplot2, the findings highlight significant regional disparities, which suggest possible influences of environmental, socio-economic, or health system factors contributing to seasonal mortality trends."

# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @citeR, @rohan and @rOpenDataToronto.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....



# Data {#sec-data}

Some of our data is of deaths (@fig-deaths), from @deathRegistryData.

### Overview Data

The

```{r warning=FALSE}

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)

```{r}
#| label: fig-planes
#| fig-cap: Relationship between wing length and width
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

analysis_data <- read_csv(here::here("data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

# Results

## Posterior predictive check

In @fig-ppcheckandposteriorvsprior-1 we implement a posterior predictive check. This shows...

In @fig-ppcheckandposteriorvsprior-2 we compare the posterior with the prior. This shows...
