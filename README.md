# The Impact of Winter and Summer Seasons on Mortality Rates in Toronto

## Overview

This project explores the potential correlation between seasonal changes and mortality rates in Toronto, specifically focusing on the winter and summer seasons. By analyzing death records, environmental factors, and temporal data, we aim to uncover whether extreme temperatures during these seasons contribute to a noticeable difference in the number of deaths.

We employ statistical analysis techniques such as regression modeling, and Poisson models to investigate the relationship between temperature fluctuations and mortality rates. The findings from this research could have implications for public health policies, particularly in urban areas susceptible to temperature extremes.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## LLM (Large Language Model) Usage

This project used assistance from OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 model for guidance on structuring the project, writing code, and generating some of the textual content for documentation.  The entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
